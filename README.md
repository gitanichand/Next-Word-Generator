# Next-Word-Generator
A Next Word Generator using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of neural network model designed to predict the next word in a sequence of text based on the words that came before it.
 It works by learning patterns and context in language over time with the help of LSTMâ€™s ability to retain information across long sequences.
